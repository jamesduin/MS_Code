  abstract =     "Supervised Learning in Multi-Layered Neural Networks
                 (MLNs) has been recently proposed through the
                 well-known Backpropagation algorithm. This is a
                 gradient method which can get stuck in local minima, as
                 simple examples can show. In this paper, some
                 conditions on the network architecture and the learning
                 environment are proposed which ensure the convergence
                 of the Backpropagation algorithm. It is proven in
                 particular that the convergence holds if the classes
                 are linearly-separable. In this case, the experience
                 gained in several experiments shows that $MLNs$ exceed
