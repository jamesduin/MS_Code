Ch3 Comments:
--Need to explain (in this chapter or earlier) where the data set originally
came from, what it represents, etc. Also, in earlier chapters describe why
this protein family is important. => done in 1.3 Hierarchical Bioinformatics DataSet


--Use hyphens in 'coarse-level', 'fine-grained', etc. => done

-- Remove page reference. => done

--Is this zero? used equation format for numbers => done

-- Removed spaces between period and table reference => done

-- Move table captions to top => done

--Change run to ran, remove ^th => done

--So, after tuning, did you hold the parameter values fixed and
re-run the experiments on a new partitioning? => done

-- Remove library duplicate, added Table, removed capitalization => done

-- If this chapter is experimental setup, why are you presenting results?
Or, is this just to tune parameters? => yes the plan is to only present
results that relate to the tuning parameters.

-- Define PR, ROC, and AUC (perhaps in
an earlier chapter). => done in 1.2 EvaluatingClassifierPerformance

-- Add text in each section, including a summary of results. Added a brief
summary in each section. => done

-- Do you discuss logistic regression in an earlier chapter?  It's
important to define how it works and what its parameters are before
discussing how you tuned them. => done in 1.1 Machine Learning



Ch4 Comments:
-- Move table captions to top => done

-- Refer to tables 4.1 - 4.2 in the main text => done

-- Reorder table references, make Accuracy lowercase,
remove figures apostrophe, add s to show. => done

-- The plots in Figures 4.5--XXX instead of the following plots => done

-- Add a semi-colon, add a because, fix mispelling => done

--So, if you're saying that performance on negatives is very
important, we should be emphasizing
ROC over PR?  Isn't that the opposite of what we discussed, or
am I missing something?, need to reword this paragraph => done

-- Replace section that follows => done

-- Fix wording, add a comma, add a period => done

-- Reword paragraph explaining FFR cost breakdown => done
